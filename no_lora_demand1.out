Hi, I am an AI assistant can help you to convert source table to target table.
Assistant: 
 To find the mapping details and operations from the source table "artist,exhibition" to the target table "result", you need to perform the following operations:

operation1: join
[
left_node_id: artist,
table_id: exhibition,
join_type: LEFT_JOIN
join_keys: [
"condition": "EQUAL",
"left_col": "Artist_ID",
"right_col": "Artist_ID"
]
]

This join operation will connect the "artist" table with the "exhibition" table based on the common "Artist_ID" column.

operation2: case when
[
function_id: case_when
condition_type: SINGLE_COLUMN
source_column: Age
conditions: [
[
operator: <
condition: 30
value: young
],
[
operator: >=
condition: 30
value: Senior
]
]
target_column: Age_Group
]

This case when operation will create the "Age_Group" column in the target table "result" based on the "Age" column from the "artist" table. It will classify the ages into two categories: "young" for ages below 30 and "Senior" for ages 30 and above.

Now, to find the mapping details and operations from the source table "people, wedding" to the target table "result":

operation1: join
[
left_node_id: people,
table_id: wedding,
join_type: LEFT_JOIN
join_keys: [
"condition": "EQUAL",
"left_col": "People_ID",
"right_col": "Male_ID"
]
]

This join operation will connect the "people" table with the "wedding" table based on the common "People_ID" column.

operation2: case when
[
function_id: case_when
condition_type: SINGLE_COLUMN
source_column: Is_Male
conditions: [
[
operator: =
condition: "True"
value: Male
],
[
operator: =
condition: "False"
value: Female
]

Hi, I am an AI assistant can help you to convert source table to target table.
Assistant: 
 To find the mapping details and operations from the [source_table]artist,exhibition[/source_table] to the [target_table]result[/target_table], we need to follow these steps:

1. Join the "artist" and "exhibition" tables with a LEFT JOIN operation:

    operation1: join
    [
    left_node_id: artist,
    table_id: exhibition,
    join_type: LEFT_JOIN
    join_keys: [
    "condition": "EQUAL",
    "left_col": "Artist_ID",
    "right_col": "Artist_ID"
    ]
    ]

2. Use the CASE WHEN function to determine the age group based on the age of the artist:

    operation2: case when
    [
    function_id: case_when
    condition_type: SINGLE_COLUMN
    source_column: Age
    conditions: [
    [
        operator: <
        condition: 30
        value: young
    ]
    [
        operator: >=
        condition: 30
        value: Senior
    ]
    ]
    target_column: Age_Group
    ]

To find the mapping details and operations from the [source_table]people,wedding[/source_table] to the [target_table]result[/target_table], follow these steps:

1. Join the "people" and "wedding" tables with a LEFT JOIN operation:

    operation1: join
    [
    left_node_id: people,
    table_id: wedding,
    join_type: LEFT_JOIN
    join_keys: [
    "condition": "EQUAL",
    "left_col": "People_ID",
    "right_col": "Male_ID"
    ]
    ]

2. Since there is no age information in the "wedding" table, we cannot determine the age group for the people in the "result" table. Therefore, we cannot perform the CASE WHEN function in this case.

Please note that the operations and answer parameters provided are specific to the given example and may not apply to every

Hi, I am an AI assistant can help you to convert source table to target table.
Assistant: 
 To complete this task, I will find the mapping details and operations from the source tables "artist" and "exhibition" to the target table "result".

First, I will join the "artist" table with the "exhibition" table to get the information related to the artists and their exhibitions. The join operation will look like this:

operation1: join
[
left_node_id: artist,
table_id: exhibition,
join_type: LEFT_JOIN
join_keys: [
"condition": "EQUAL",
"left_col": "Artist_ID",
"right_col": "Artist_ID"
]
]

Next, I will use the "case when" function to determine the age group of each artist based on their age. The "case when" function will look like this:

operation2: case when
[
function_id: case_when
condition_type: SINGLE_COLUMN
source_column: Age
conditions: [
[
operator: <
condition: 30
value: young
],
[
operator: >=
condition: 30
value: Senior
]
]
target_column: Age_Group
]

Now, I will find the mapping details and operations from the source tables "people" and "wedding" to the target table "result".

First, I will join the "people" table with the "wedding" table to get the information related to the people attending the weddings. The join operation will look like this:

operation1: join
[
left_node_id: people,
table_id: wedding,
join_type: LEFT_JOIN
join_keys: [
"condition": "EQUAL",
"left_col": "Male_ID",
"right_col": "Male_ID"
]
]

Next, I will use the "case when" function to determine the age group of each person based on their age. The "case when" function will look like this:

operation2: case when
[
function_id: case_when
condition_type: SINGLE_COLUMN
source_column: Age
conditions: [
[
operator: <
condition: 30
value: young
